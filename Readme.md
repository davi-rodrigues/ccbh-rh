# Cosmological Coupled Black Holes with Regular Horizons: field equations derivation

Here we verify and detail the field equations derivation from [2601.03296](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03296), by Cadoni, Lima, Pitzalis, Rodrigues and Sanna.

This code is based on the FTeV package , which can be downloaded from [FTeV](https://github.com/davi-rodrigues/FTeV).

* The `nb` file is a Mathematica notebook (created with Wolfram Mathematica 14.3). It can be opened with Mathematica or with [WLJS Notebook](https://wljs.io/).
* The `wl` file is a plain text file that can be opened in any text editor. 
* The `ipynb` file contains the main results and can be opened in Jupyter. It can be executed freely using the Wolfram Engine.
